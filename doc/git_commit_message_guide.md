# Git commit message

How to write a great Git commit message:

1. Begin the commit message with a short title that summarizes the change.

2. Start the title with an imperative present active verb: Add, Fix, Optimize, etc.

3. Format the title: start with a capital word, use up to 50 characters, and end without a period.

4. Optionally follow the title by a blank line, then a more thorough description. 


## Title examples

Title examples of good commit messages:

  * Add feature for foo
  * Drop feature for foo
  * Fix bug when foo is missing
  * Bump version of foo dependency
  * Make foo integration script
  * Start foo feature flag
  * Stop foo feature flag
  * Refactor foo for clarity
  * Reformat foo to remove whitespace
  * Optimize foo for speed and memory
  * Document foo protocol


## Imperatives

* Add = Create a capability e.g. feature, test, dependency.
* Drop = Delete a capability e.g. feature, test, dependency.
* Fix = Fix an issue e.g. bug, typo, accident, misstatement.
* Bump = Increase the version of something e.g. a dependency.
* Make = Change the build process, or tools, or infrastructure.
* Start = Begin doing something; e.g. enable a toggle, feature flag, etc.
* Stop = End doing something; e.g. disable a toggle, feature flag, etc.
* Refactor = A change that MUST be just refactoring.
* Reformat = A change that MUST be just formatting, e.g. omit whitespace.
* Optimize = A change that MUST be just about performance, e.g. speed up code.
* Document = A change that MUST be only in the documentation, e.g. help files.
